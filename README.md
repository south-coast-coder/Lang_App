This simple GUI allows the user to (attempt) to upload a pdf written in a foreign language.

The python program will use a third-party library which uses AI (I believe) to 'read' the pdf and generate text.

The user can then explore the text, clicking on any word to see a translation and adding their own notes (which are saved) on a sidebar.
